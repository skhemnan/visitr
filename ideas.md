# Additional Ideas for project
- Account for temperature. Switch statement, each case being a temp range.
- Temp range will determine what to pack
- weather condition determines what to bring (umbrella, scarf, gloves, etc)
- Account for temp highs and lows. (It could get chilly at night, bring a jacket)
